# Introduction 
The crustacean fisheries off central south Chile date back to
1953 when the species yellow squat lobster (*Cervimunida johni*) and red squat
lobster (*Pleuroncodes monodon*) began to be exploited. Since 1972 landings of
both species started to differentiate and the maximum landings (10.322 tones) of
yellow squat lobster was registered in 1997 [@canalesArana2012]. The 
yellow squat lobster was divided in two fisheries units in 1996 that nowadays 
correspond to 26º03’LS - 30º30’LS (North Unit) and 30º30’LS -38º48’LS (South 
Unit) [@bucarey2015; @canalesArana2012]. This work is developed for
the North fishery unit of the Chilean yellow squat lobster.

The current fishery management of the squat lobster fisheries in Chile is based 
on the total allowed catch (TAC) system. Decisions about catch level are based 
on the status of the squat lobsters referred to the current level of spawning 
biomass that allow the stock to be near or around the maximum sustainable yield 
(MSY) (Bucarey et al. 2015). To estimate the spawning biomass a single-species 
stock assessment model is used. The model corresponds to an integrated 
age-structure model (Maunder and Punt 2013) that encompasses multiple data types
to reveal the population dynamics and estimate both model parameters and derived
population and management outputs. However, because in crustacean species age 
assignation is difficult, length composition data is used to fit the model.

Maunder and Piner (2015) discussed that critical biological and fisheries 
processes such as growth, natural mortality, recruitment, and selectivity are 
still issues that remain unsolved in stock assessment models, and without this 
knowledge, assumptions need to be made. However incorrect assumptions can have a
substantial impact on stock assessment results and management advice. For 
instance, [@aires2015improved] showed that the estimated depletion level
(ratio of the spawning biomass) and fishing mortality rates were highly 
sensitive to the assumed value of $L_{\infty}$ as well as the variability of length-at-age.

In the Chilean yellow squat lobster stock assessment model, two important 
population process, individual growth and recruitment, carried important 
assumptions. The mean length-at age in the growth process follows the von 
Bertalanffy function with parameters $k$ and $L_{\infty}$ assumed fixed and obtained from 
external studies. The mean length at the first age (L1) as well as the 
coefficient of variation of the mean length at age (VLA) are estimated in the 
model in order to fit the length composition data that is converted to age 
through a simulated length-at-age key. The recruitment process is modelled with 
underlying the assumption that a Beverton and Holt (BH) stock-recruitment 
relationship exist with a steepness value of $h=1$. The assumption is based in the
lack of reliability of the Chilean yellow squat lobster data to estimate the BH 
stock recruitment relationship (Paya et al. 2014). Thus, the recruitment is 
modelled through annual random deviations that follows a lognormal distribution 
with a variance that is assumed fixed, while the averaged recruitment and annual
deviations are parameters to be estimated. Here, we aim to investigate the 
impact of the assumptions of growth and recruitment process in the stock 
assessment results and management advice indicators of the Chilean yellow squat 
lobster fishery. We used the stock assessment models developed for the Chilean 
squat lobster fisheries (Bucarey et al. 2015) to carry a sensitivity analysis of
different scenarios of the L1 and VLA, in combination with scenarios of h and 
the coefficient of variation of the recruitment (CVR). The response of five 
variables of the stock assessment results were analyzed as well as five used for
management advice. Later, a simulation analysis was conducted to assess the 
precision of the stock assessment model in estimates the parameters that cause 
the higher variation in the stock assessment results and management advice 
variables.

# Methods 
## Yellow squat lobster stock assessment model 
The Chilean yellow
squat lobster model assume that in the north part (26°03’-30°30’ LS) of the
distribution area of the species there is a closed stock of yellow squat lobster
independently of south stock. The assessment covers a period of time from 1985
to 2015 and encompasses the following sources of data, i) official landings, ii)
catch per unit effort (CPUE), iii) survey biomass and iv) length composition of
the catches and survey. Biological parameters such us, natural mortality,
maturity and growth are estimated outside the model. Growth is differentiated by
sex, natural mortality is invariant and the vulnerability to the fishing gear
and survey is invariant and follows a logistic function. The observation model
of the landings, CPUE, and biomass survey assume a lognormal distribution of the
error and the length composition of the catches and survey assume a multinomial 
distribution.  The parameters are estimated by the minimization of the sum of 
the negative log-likelihood of each time series. The yellow squat lobster model 
is implemented in a computational routine in the software AD Model Builder for 
non-lineal statistical models (<http://admb-project.org/>). Although the stock 
assessment model of the yellow squat lobster is available at <http://www.ifop.cl>. we 
present in the Appendix section a summary of the mathematical description of the
stock assessment model.

## Performance measures 
To measures the impact of the effect of the assumptions 
of growth and recruitment in the stock assessment result and management advice 
indicators the following variable were used. Total biomass in the last year 
(TB), spawning biomass in the last year (SB), averaged recruitment (R), yield at 
the target referent point ($Y_{MSY}$), virginal spawning biomass (BD$_0$). We also analyzed
the effect in the following MA indicators, the ratio between the last year yield
(Y) and yield at the target reference point $\left(\frac{Y}{Y_{MSY}}\right)$, the ratio of last year of the 
fishing mortality (F) and the target fishing mortality $\left(\frac{F}{F_{MSY}}\right)$, the spawning biomass 
of the last year (SB), and the virginal spawning biomass , the fishing mortality
of the last year (F) and target fishing mortality $\left(\frac{SB}{SB_{MSY}}\right)$. All the measures were 
standardized with regarding to the Base scenario, this means all the SAR and MAI
variables were divided their values in Base scenario in order to be comparable.

## Sensitivity analysis 
### Sensitivity analysis to growth assumptions 
Here we explored the effects of the changes in the mean length-at-entry age (L1) and the
variation of the length-at-age (VLA) of the von Bertalanffy growth model in the
SAI and MAI (see the last section for a detail description of performance
measures). A total of nine (9) scenarios were assessed that contain changes in
L1 and VLA (Table 1). VLA is obtain as $cv=\dfrac{\sigma_a}{l_a}$ where cv correspond to coefficient of
variation at age, $\sigma_a$ is the standard deviation of the length-at-age and $l_a$ is the mean
length-at-age. L1 is obtained as  $L_a=L_\infty( 1-e^{-k(a-t_o)})$ with $L_\infty$ and k obtained from external studies.
The changes were made comparing the values used in the current stock assessment
of the yellow squat lobster named here as Base. Values of L1 and VLA were varied
adding and subtracting a 10% to the base case. Values were used fixed in the
stock assessment. The Base values corresponded to $cv_f=0.0369$ and $cv_m=0.083$ for females ($f$) and males
($m$) respectively, while the L1 was $l_f=13.73$ cm for females and y $l_m=20.44$ cm for males. For each
run the convergence was checked by proving the invertibility of hessian matrix.

### Sensitivity analysis to recruitment assumptions 
In this sensitivity analysis
we run different scenarios of recruitment variability and values of steepness,
$h$. The Base scenario assumed a recruitment variance (VAR) of $\sigma^2_R=0.6$, and an steepness
value of $h=1$. Combinations of steepness values of 0.75 and 1, and VAR of 1,
0.6 and 0.2 were assessed (Table 2). All the scenarios shown in Table 1 were run
for combination of VAR and h presented in Table 2. A total of 54 runs allow us
to assess the effect of the assumptions of the growth and productivity for
yellow squat lobster on the SAR and MAI.

## Simulations analysis 
In this analysis we assessed how precisely the stock
assessment model estimate the parameters that produce the highest variation in
SAR and MAI. To do this the stock assessment model (section 2.1) was used as a
simulation model (SM) and as the estimation model (EM) for the parameters L1,
VLA and h. The SM was conditioned to data and parameters of the Base scenario,
together with the virginal spawning biomass, averaged recruitment ($R$),
recruitment deviations and the capturability coefficients of the Base scenario.
A total of 100 data sets were simulated through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) using the error from likelihood function of Base scenario. Process error
of the anual recruitments were simulated asuming a value $\sigma^2_R=0.6$ and two scenarios of
L1 and VLA were assessed (Table 3). Later, the simulated data sets were added to
four scenarios of estimation to explore the predictibility of the L1, VLA and
the impact of the a wrong asumption of the steepness level, $h$. The precision of
the parameters was assessed comparing the values from the simulations with those
from the estimation process. The median value was used as a measure of the
biased of the estimation process as,
\[ 
MBR=median\left(\frac{\overline{\theta} - \theta}{\theta}\right), 
\]
where $\theta$ is then value of the parameter
estimated, and  is the true parameter use in the simulation analysis. In all
scenarios we calculate the coefficient of variation (CV) of each parameter
studied.

# Results 
## Sensitivity analysis 
The effects of the changes in the mean
length-at-entry age (L1) and the variation of mean length at age (VLA) on the
stock assessment results (SAR) for an steepness condition of h= 1 are summarized
in Fig. 1a. The higher impacts are produced by changes in the L1 rather than
VLA. The performance measures of the assessment most impacted was the $R$. In all
scenarios the increments of L1 and VLA have a positive impact in the $R$ level. The
deviation compare to base scenario was in average of a 20%. A less positive
impact in the stock variables TB, SB and SBo was observed for the different
combination L1 and VLA (Table 1). 

The highest impact in the management advice
indicators when the productivity h=1 (Fig. 1b) was due to changes in L1 and then
to the changes in VLA. Indeed, the L1 for escenarios of variation between -10%
and +10% (Fig. 1b) affected the F and the ratio $\frac{F}{F_{MSY}}$ in similar magnitude and in
average in a 15% compared to base scenario. In the same way, but in lower
magnitude the management indicators F and the ratio $\frac{F}{F_{MSY}}$ are reduce when the VLA
increases (Fig. 1b). Management indicators FMSY and $\frac{Y}{Y_{MSY}}$ were insentitive to most of
the scenarios L1 and VLA, only an small variation of a 2% in average was
observed. Fig. 1b also shown that the ratio $\frac{SB}{SB_{MSY}}$ increases near to a 4% when L1 y
VLA increases. The effect is expected since the fishing mortality rate F reduces.

Fig. 2 summarize the results of the combination of the 9 scenarios of variation
in L1 and VLA when the steepness value was, h=0.75. The impact of h and VAR in
the stock assessment variables and management advice indicators are negligible
compared to the effect when growth parameters changed (Fig. 1 and 2). For
instance, we observed lightly changes in those scenarios where the recruitment
variance arisen from a distribution with a variance of 0.6 $(\sigma^2_R=0.6)$ when h goes from
h=1 (Fig. 1) to h=0.75 (Fig.2). Similar results were observed when the variance
was 1, $(\sigma^2_R=1.0)$ and h changed from 1 to 0.75. The most notable effect was due to changes
in the assumptions of the recruitment variation, when VAR was small $(\sigma^2_R=0.2)$ and a
constant average recruitment is assumed $(h=1)$. In this case, both stock
assessment variables and management advice indicators are highly impacted when
the productivity h changes. In the scenarios where h=1 (Fig. 1) all the stock
assessment variables with the exception of $R$ underestimated the base scenario.
The effect propagates to the management advice indicators showing a different
pattern of change when is compared with the others combination of scenarios
(Fig. 1 and 2).

## Simulations 
Table 4 summarizes the median relative bias (MRB) between the
estimated parameters and those used in the simulation analysis, and the
coefficient of variation of the parameters that arise from a reliable solution
of the optimization process (convergence).  In the scenario 1, where the growth
and recruitment parameters are estimated together L1 and h shown a low level of
being estimated with confidence (MRS $\geq$ 0.05). In addition, the parameter h
presents a high variability (CV $\geq$ 0.05). When the purpose of the simulation is
focused only in the growth parameters (Table 4, scenario 2) the reliability of
the estimation increases owing to that the bias of L1 and VLA are reduced. In
this scenario the CV of the growth parameter are lower than a 5%. 
The reliability in the parameters estimated in the scenario 2 is shown also by the
percentage of convergence equivalent. Indeed, when all parameters are estimated
together (Table 4, scenario 1) the percentage of convergence was lower (46%)
compared to the scenario where only growth parameter are estimated with a
convergence level of 100% (Table 4, scenario 2).

The scenario 3 and 4 tried to
explore which of the growth parameters show the greater estimability. Results in
Table 4 reveal that VLA has higher reliability to be precisely estimated in at
least 94% of the run, with bias level (MRB) and variability (CV) lower than a
5%. As it was expected L1 estimation shown the highest bias (Table 4, scenario
3) and variability because is the parameter that has the higher impact in the
stock assessment variables and management advice indicators. As it was shown in
Fig. 1 and 2 the recruitment (R) is the variable that have the higher impact
respect to the variation in the growth parameters, therefore it is expected a
level of confusion in the estimation of h and L1 (Table 4, scenario 1) because
the increase in both parameters suggest a positive trend in the recruitment.

# Discussion 
## Summary and discussion of the main findings 
The main findings of
this work indicates that the stock assessment variables of the yellow squat
lobster and management indicators sensitive to changes in the growth parameters
are the recruitment R, fishing mortality $F$ and the ratio of $\frac{F}{F_{MSY}}$ which are highly impacted by the changes in the growth assumption. On the contrary to what we
expected changes in the productivity level of the stock (h) and in the
assumptions of the recruitment variability shown less impact in the variables of
the stock and management.  Therefore, changes in the Chilean yellow squat
lobster growth process seem an important driver of the changes in the size of
population mediated through the recruitment.

Similar results have been found XX showing that XXX, together with particular
issues of this findings that need a deepest insight.

The highest impact in the stock assessment variables and management advice
indicators were due to changes in L1 and VLA.

En efecto, en el escenario 1 (todos los parámetros estimados a la vez) el
porcentaje de convergencia fue reducido (46%) comparado al escenario 2 (100%),
posiblemente debido a que la incorporación de los parámetros de reclutamiento
tiende a confundir el proceso de estimación debido a la correlación entre el
crecimiento y reclutamiento.

## Implications of this work 
Ours simulation findings suggest that in the
process of parameterized the Chilean squat lobster stock assessment model is
better to avoid the combined estimation of the parameters that describe the
growth and recruitment process. If the combined estimation is avoided, we
believe the bias in the estimation of the stock assessment variable and
management advice indicator will decrease. In addition, ours results could be
apply to other stock assessment model with a similar framework than the one
presented in Appendix, and in particular to other Chilean crustacean fisheries.

## Caveats and extensions 
It is important to notice that all the simulated
scenarios tested in this work were set specifically to answer the question about
the precision of the growth parameters estimation, therefore issues about the
performance of the model in other population or management process is beyond the
scope of this work. A way to reduce the impact of the assumption of individual
growth on the management of yellow squat lobster stock assessment and other
Chilean stocks would be to estimate the growth within the stock assessment
model. Thus, information coming from external estimation of growth and their
uncertainty would be included as any other type of information in an integrated
model [@aires2015improved].
